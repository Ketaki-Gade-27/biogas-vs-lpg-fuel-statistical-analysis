## A Comparative Analysis of Bio-gas and LPG Utilization in Rural Households

This repository contains my M.Sc. Statistics research project that compares the utilization of Bio-gas and LPG as domestic fuels in rural households of Kaulage village.

The study explores factors influencing fuel choice, annual household expenditure, switching behavior, and the role of government assistance in promoting biogas usage.

### Statistical Analysis Performed:
- **Chi-square test** – Relation between LPG price changes and household budgets.
- **Fisher Exact Test** – Association between income sources and type of fuel used.
- **Kruskal-Wallis test** – Difference in annual fuel expenditure across fuel types.
- **Regression Model** – Predict annual household fuel expenditure.

### Key Findings:
- LPG is the most commonly used domestic fuel, while some households prefer dual usage (Bio-gas + LPG).
- Government assistance plays a major role in biogas plant installations.
- Fuel type is associated with household income and LPG price sensitivity.
- Annual household fuel expenditure differs significantly across fuel types.

---

### Future Scope:
- Extend study to multiple villages/regions for wider insights.
- Long-term monitoring of fuel-switching behavior.
- Policy-level recommendations for cleaner energy adoption in rural households.
